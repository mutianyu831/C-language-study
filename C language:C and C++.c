C and C++ are both powerful, widely used programming languages, but they have significant differences. Here's an overview:

### 1. **Paradigm**
   - **C**: C is a procedural programming language. It focuses on functions and the sequence of actions or commands that manipulate data.
   - **C++**: C++ is a multi-paradigm language. It supports both procedural programming (like C) and object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows for the organization of code using classes and objects, making it more modular and scalable.

### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - **C**: Does not support object-oriented programming. It focuses on functions and data, and doesn't have features like classes, objects, inheritance, or polymorphism.
   - **C++**: C++ is built with object-oriented principles, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, allowing for more complex and reusable code.

### 3. **Memory Management**
   - **C**: Memory management is manual in C. Developers use functions like `malloc()` and `free()` to allocate and deallocate memory.
   - **C++**: C++ also supports manual memory management, but it provides more features like constructors and destructors for automatic memory handling in object-oriented code. Additionally, C++ introduces the `new` and `delete` operators for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

### 4. **Standard Libraries**
   - **C**: The C standard library is simpler and more focused on basic operations like input/output, string manipulation, and memory management.
   - **C++**: The C++ Standard Library is more extensive, including features like the Standard Template Library (STL) which provides data structures (like vectors, lists, and maps) and algorithms (like sort, search, etc.) that simplify coding tasks.

### 5. **Function Overloading**
   - **C**: Does not support function overloading. Each function must have a unique name.
   - **C++**: Supports function overloading, meaning you can define multiple functions with the same name but with different parameters.

### 6. **Name Mangling**
   - **C**: C does not use name mangling, meaning the function names are kept as-is.
   - **C++**: C++ uses name mangling to support function overloading and other features like namespaces and classes, which can result in slightly different function names in the compiled code.

### 7. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - **C**: C does not support inheritance or polymorphism.
   - **C++**: C++ supports inheritance, allowing one class to inherit attributes and behaviors from another, and polymorphism, which allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling more flexible and reusable code.

### 8. **Exception Handling**
   - **C**: C does not have built-in support for exception handling. Errors are often handled manually using error codes or special return values.
   - **C++**: C++ has a robust exception handling mechanism using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords, which simplifies error handling and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

### 9. **Compatibility**
   - **C**: C is often seen as a lower-level language compared to C++, providing more direct control over hardware and memory. C is often used for systems programming, embedded systems, and situations where performance is critical.
   - **C++**: C++ can be thought of as an extension of C. C++ compilers are usually compatible with C code, so you can mix C and C++ code, though C++'s advanced features (OOP, templates, etc.) might not be compatible with C code.

### 10. **Syntax and Features**
   - **C**: C has a simpler syntax with fewer features. It's often considered more lightweight and easier to learn initially.
   - **C++**: C++ has more complex syntax due to the inclusion of object-oriented and generic programming features. This makes it more powerful but also harder to master compared to C.

### Summary:

- **C** is best suited for low-level programming and when you need to work directly with hardware or operating systems.
- **C++** is ideal for larger, more complex systems that require object-oriented design, reusable code, and sophisticated memory management.

While C++ is an extension of C and includes all the features of C, C++ offers more tools for modern software development, especially in scenarios that demand code reusability, maintainability, and abstraction.
